## üè¢ Client Brief: "Ukelele" ‚Äì Global Online Retail Platform

### üìå Company Overview
Ukelele is a fast-scaling e-commerce platform transitioning from a mid-sized retailer to a global leader. Operating across multiple countries and verticals, it seeks to embed data science across departments to break down silos and drive intelligent decision-making.

### üìâ Business Challenge
Despite increasing investments in marketing, conversions have plateaued and customer engagement is inconsistent. The leadership suspects that undifferentiated campaign strategies and poor customer targeting are leading to wasted spend and missed opportunities for growth.

### üß© Problem Statement
Ukelele‚Äôs marketing budget is expanding, but returns are not scaling proportionally. The team struggles with undifferentiated targeting, customer churn, and low cross-sell uptake. Leadership demands a sharper, data-driven understanding of customer behaviour to personalize marketing efforts.

|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Customer Behavior      | Each customer ID maps to a unique user with consistent behavior.           |
| Churn Definition       | Customer is "churned" if inactive for 6+ months (UCI) or labeled churn (Kaggle). |
| CLTV Time Horizon      | Estimated using 6 months of past behavior.                                 |
| Marketing Strategy     | A/B tests simulate seasonal/product-based campaigns.                       |
| Email Engagement       | CTR assumed or simulated.                                                  |
| Geography              | Country used for region-level segmentation.                                |

### üîç Data-Level Assumptions

|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Revenue Calculation    | Revenue = `Quantity √ó UnitPrice`; negative quantities are returns.         |
| Product Co-occurrence  | Market Basket based on `InvoiceNo` representing sessions.                  |
| Data Quality           | Cleaned data: no duplicates, standardized formats.                         |
| Campaign Assignment    | A/B test groups are random and balanced.                                   |
